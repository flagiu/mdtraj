This is a test for PBC with TRICLINIC BOXES.

666 LJ atoms at temperature T=1, density=1.0227, within the following triclinic box:
	xx xy xz yy yz zz
	8.8 -3.5 2.1 7.4 1.3 10.0

traj.xyz.save : contains both liquid and crystallized phases.
traj.liq.xyz.save : only liquid.
traj.xtal.xyz.save : only crystallized.

Does the liquid g(r) converge to 1 at large r?
 No... idk the error
