This is a test for PBC with NON-CUBIC BOXES.

666 LJ atoms at temperature T=1, density=1.0227, within the following orthorombic box:
	xx xy xz yy yz zz
	6.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.0 18.1
(Input LAMMPS file: in.lmp)

traj.xyz.save : contains a XYZ trajectory in the liquid phase

It can be visualized with VMD: vmd -xyz traj.xyz.save -e script.vmd

Does the liquid g(r) converge to 1 at large r?
