This is part of a test for:
 - PBC with NON-CUBIC BOXES.
 - S(q).

666 LJ atoms at temperature T=1, density=1.0219, within the following cubic box:
	xx xy xz yy yz zz
	8.67 0.0 0.0 8.67 0.0 8.67
(Input LAMMPS file: in.lmp)

traj.xyz.save : contains a XYZ trajectory in the liquid phase

It can be visualized with VMD: vmd -xyz traj.xyz.save -e script.vmd

Does the liquid g(r) converge to 1 at large r?
 No... idk the error
