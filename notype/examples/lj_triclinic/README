This is a test for PBC with NON-CUBIC BOXES.

666 LJ atoms at temperature T=1, density=1.0227, within the following triclinic box:
	xx xy xz yy yz zz
	8.8 -3.5 2.1 7.4 1.3 10.0
(Input LAMMPS file: in.lmp)

dump.lammpstrj: contains a LAMMPS trajectory

They can be visualized with VMD: vmd dump.lammpstrj -e script.vmd

Does the liquid g(r) converge to 1 at large r?
 No... idk the error
